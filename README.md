# API_Music

This is a music api that I have created for a personnal project beacause I wanted to keep track of my music collection beaucause I have a lot of music in diff√©rents format and
sometimes I forget or I'm not sure if I have a specific album or version of an album. This application is inspired by another one of my project for a friend who as a lot of lego
and he wanted to keep track of his collection so I have created a lego application who is called Motify who is a bit smaller than this one but the idea is the same.
